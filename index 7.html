        including a display, keyboard, and a trackpad in a single unit. Their importance lies in their
        ability to store large amounts of data and run demanding applications, all while being 
        lightweight and easy to transport It ultimately depends on your specific needs, preferences,
        and how you plan to use your laptop. For most users, a 14 to 15-inch laptop offers a good 
        balance of screen space and portability. However, if you prioritize mobility, a 13-inch 
        ultraportable might be ideal Computer technology is an expanding branch of engineering, with roots in both 
        electrical engineering and computer science. It includes the related areas of computer 
        hardware and software; computer interfacing, programming, and networking; analog and digital

      Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence possessed by the machines under which they
      can perform various functions with human help. With the help of A.I, machines will be 
      able to learn, solve problems, plan things, think, etc. Artificial Intelligence, for 
      example, is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that simulates human
      intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform various tasks like problem-solving,
      learning, and decision-making
